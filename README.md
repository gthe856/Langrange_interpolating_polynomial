# Langrange interpolating polynomial
From Wikipedia:
  In numerical analysis, Lagrange polynomials are used for polynomial interpolation.
  Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a given data set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the dataset
  Polynomials can be used to approximate complicated curves, for example, the shapes of letters in typography, given a few points. 
  A relevant application is the evaluation of the natural logarithm and trigonometric functions: pick a few known data points, create a lookup table, and interpolate between those data points. 
  This results in significantly faster computations. Polynomial interpolation also forms the basis for algorithms in numerical quadrature and numerical ordinary differential equations and Secure Multi Party Computation, Secret Sharing schemes.
